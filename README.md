# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
In the problem, you will program your first ever computer game!  Using the conditionals (if,
elif, else), the while loop (and continue, break), logic operations (and, or, not), and
the string formatting, you are asked to write a program that determines the result of Rockpaper-
scissors game based on two Players’ inputs. You program is required to print the result
according to the game rule.

Create a program that allows two players to play a Rock‐Paper‐Scissors game. When executing
your program, it first prints out a truth table for all the possible inputs and the corresponding
outcomes for two players (“Player A” and “Player B”). This will benefit your coding on creating
the game. Then your program is required to generate the outcome of the Rock‐paper‐scissors
game. The program will first ask players A and B for inputs, then display the corresponding
outcome. After one round of the game, your program will continue to ask players’ inputs. The
game will be terminated if either Player A or Player B enters "bye". The only valid inputs for
players A and B are "rock", "paper", "scissors", and "bye". If either player inputs
anything else, your program should output "Invalid input. Please enter again."
message, then asks the player to enter again.
